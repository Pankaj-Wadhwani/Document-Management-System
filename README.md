# Document-Management-System
Document Management System is a database project implemented using Java

(This is my first Java Project)

It can be used by any Institute/College/school  to maintain record of documents,to record which teacher submitted whic document on which date.
There is one login i.e admin login only,admin can add department of college,teachers of eacch department ,subject of each teacher.

Example:If any teacher submitted some document,admin will update in this application.If teacher want that document back,teacher can reissue the document.
c
Whenever teacher submits or reissue any document,a mail can sent by this app to that teacher(if admin wants to send).
